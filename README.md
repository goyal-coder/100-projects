# 100 Projects in One Folder 🚀💻

Welcome to **100 Projects in One Folder**—a chaotic yet genius collection of my wild coding experiments, mini-projects, and questionable decisions. 🤓🔥

## 📂 What’s Inside?
A bunch of projects ranging from:
- 🔥 Frontend madness (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- 🎨 Random creative stuff (SASS, animations, UI/UX ideas)
- 🧠 Brainfarts that seemed like a good idea at 3 AM

## 😵 Why So Many?
Because why not? The goal is to **learn, break things, fix them (hopefully), and grow**. Also, it sounds cool to say, *"I built 100 projects"* in casual conversations. 😎

## 🔥 How to Use
1. Clone this madness:  
2. Pick a random folder (it’s a surprise every time 🎁)
3. Run it, break it, fix it, and enjoy!

## 🏆 Challenge: Can You Survive This Repo?
If you dare to explore, drop a ⭐ if you find something cool (or weird). Let’s turn this into the most legendary repo ever! 🚀
